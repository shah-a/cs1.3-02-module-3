# Linked List Stacks and Queues

## Part 1

We are going to implement a stack and queue using a linked list. In class we went over how to implement both using a Python list which under the hood is really a dynamic array. 

Because linked lists are another type of linear data structure that implements the abstract data type of a List we can easily adapt them to behaving like a stack or queue. 

Using the starter code provided in LinkedListStack.py and LinkedListQueue.py implement a stack and queue using a linked list by completing the empty methods.

A completed linked list is provided for you in SinglyLinkedList.py, feel free to use any of the already completed methods to implement your stack and queue methods.

Once you are finished make sure that your code passess the provided unit tests.
